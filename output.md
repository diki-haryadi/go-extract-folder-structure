<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

// .git/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample
#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

#!/bin/sh
#
# An example hook script to block unannotated tags from entering.
# Called by "git receive-pack" with arguments: refname sha1-old sha1-new
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "update".
#
# Config
# ------
# hooks.allowunannotated
#   This boolean sets whether unannotated tags will be allowed into the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletetag
#   This boolean sets whether deleting tags will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowmodifytag
#   This boolean sets whether a tag may be modified after creation. By default
#   it won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletebranch
#   This boolean sets whether deleting branches will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.denycreatebranch
#   This boolean sets whether remotely creating branches will be denied
#   in the repository.  By default this is allowed.

## API Documentation

### OAuth2 Endpoints

#### Token Endpoint
```http
POST /api/v1/oauth/tokens
Authorization: Basic {client_credentials}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

Supported grant types:
1. Authorization Code
```
grant_type=authorization_code
code={authorization_code}
redirect_uri={redirect_uri}
```

2. Client Credentials
```
grant_type=client_credentials
scope={scope}
```

3. Password
```
grant_type=password
username={username}
password={password}
scope={scope}
```

4. Refresh Token
```
grant_type=refresh_token
refresh_token={refresh_token}
```

#### Token Introspection
```http
POST /api/v1/oauth/introspect
Authorization: Basic {client_credentials}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

token={token}
token_type_hint={access_token|refresh_token}
```

### Client Management API

#### Register New Client
```http
POST /api/v1/oauth/clients
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "My Application",
    "redirect_uris": ["https://app.example.com/callback"],
    "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
    "scope": "read write",
    "confidential": true
}
```

#### List Clients
```http
GET /api/v1/oauth/clients
```

#### Update Client
```http
PUT /api/v1/oauth/clients/{client_id}
```

#### Delete Client
```http
DELETE /api/v1/oauth/clients/{client_id}
```

### User Management API

#### Register User
```http
POST /api/v1/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "john.doe@example.com",
    "password": "secure_password",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "roles": ["user"]
}
```

#### User Operations
```http
PUT /api/v1/users/profile          # Update user profile
POST /api/v1/users/reset-password  # Reset password
POST /api/v1/users/verify-email    # Verify email
GET /api/v1/users                  # List users (admin only)
PUT /api/v1/users/{user_id}        # Update user (admin only)
DELETE /api/v1/users/{user_id}     # Delete user (admin only)
```

### Scope Management API

#### Create Scope
```http
POST /api/v1/oauth/scopes
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "read_profile",
    "description": "Read user profile information"
}
```

#### Scope Operations
```http
GET /api/v1/oauth/scopes           # List scopes
PUT /api/v1/oauth/scopes/{scope_id}      # Update scope
DELETE /api/v1/oauth/scopes/{scope_id}    # Delete scope
```

### Consent Management API

#### Create Consent
```http
POST /api/v1/oauth/consents
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "client_id": "client_id",
    "scopes": ["read", "write"]
}
```

#### Consent Operations
```http
GET /api/v1/oauth/consents                # List consents
DELETE /api/v1/oauth/consents/{consent_id} # Revoke consent
```

### Security & Monitoring API

#### Token Management
```http
GET /api/v1/oauth/tokens          # List active tokens
POST /api/v1/oauth/tokens/revoke  # Revoke specific token
POST /api/v1/oauth/tokens/bulk-revoke # Bulk revoke tokens
```

#### Monitoring
```http
GET /api/v1/audit-logs           # View audit logs
GET /api/v1/oauth/rate-limits    # Check rate limit status
GET /api/v1/oauth/sessions       # List active sessions
DELETE /api/v1/oauth/sessions/{session_id} # End session
```

## Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication using HTTP Basic Authentication with client credentials:
```
Authorization: Basic base64(client_id:client_secret)
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns errors in the following format:
```json
{
    "error": "error_code",
    "error_description": "Detailed error message",
    "error_uri": "https://documentation/errors/error_code"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting per client. Current limits can be checked via the rate-limiting endpoint.

## Security Considerations

1. Always use HTTPS in production
2. Implement proper password hashing
3. Store client secrets securely
4. Implement token encryption
5. Set up proper CORS configuration
6. Enable audit logging
7. Implement IP whitelisting where appropriate

## Database Schema

The server requires the following database tables:
- users
- clients
- access_tokens
- refresh_tokens
- authorization_codes
- scopes
- client_scopes
- user_consents
- audit_logs

This project uses PostgreSQL as its primary data store, and Migrate for managing database migrations.

## Migrations

This code repository use [Migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) as a database migration tool. It helps you manage and keep track of database schema changes in your Go applications.

### Installation

To install migrate cli please go to [installation guide](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/blob/master/cmd/migrate/README.md).

### Usage

You can use the following command to set the PG_URL environment variable and then use it in the migrate command:

```bash
export PG_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]
```

This can be useful if you need to run the command multiple times and don't want to type out the full database URL each time.

To create a new migration, use the following command:

```makefile
migrate-create: # Target for running 'create'
	migrate create -ext sql -dir db/migrations $(NAME)
```

This will create a new migration file in the db/migrations directory with the name [timestamp]_[migration_name].up.sql and [timestamp]_[migration_name].down.sql, which contain the SQL statements for applying and rolling back the migration, respectively.

To run the migrations, use the following command:

```makefile
migrate-up:   # Target for running 'up' command
 migrate -path db/migrations -database  $(PG_URL) up
```

To rollback the last migration, use the following command:

```makefile
migrate-down: # Target for running 'down' command
	migrate -path db/migrations -database $(PG_URL) down
```

To drop all tables and sequences in the database, use the following command:

```makefile
migrate-drop: # Target for running 'drop' command
	migrate drop -database $(PG_URL)
```

**Note**: This command will permanently delete all data in the database, so use caution when running it.

To apply or rollback a migration to a specific version , use the following command:

```makefile
migrate-force: # Target for running 'force' command
 migrate -path db/migrations -database $(PG_URL) force $(VERSION)
```

This is useful when you want to undo or redo a specific migration, or when you want to apply a migration that was previously rolled back.
**Note**: The migrate force command should be used with caution, as it can permanently alter the state of the database. Make sure you have a backup of your data before using this command.

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. It is commonly used as the primary data store for web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.

Some key features of PostgreSQL include:

- Support for multiple data types, including text, numerical, and spatial data
- Support for ACID transactions, which ensure the consistency and integrity of data
- Support for triggers, stored procedures, and views, which allow you to define custom logic and data manipulation operations
- Support for full-text search and advanced indexing options, which enable fast querying and data retrieval
- Support for JSON and JSONB data types, which allow you to store and manipulate complex, nested data structures

### Installation

To get started with PostgreSQL, you will need to install the database server and client libraries on your machine. There are various ways to install PostgreSQL, including using a package manager, downloading the binaries from the official website or using an existing Docker Compose file.

Follow these steps:

1. Make sure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.
2. Open the docker-compose.yml file in your project directory.
3. If the PostgreSQL service definition already exists in Docker Compose file, you can start the PostgreSQL container by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the PostgreSQL container in detached mode.

To stop the container, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

### Connecting to the Database

Replace myuser, mypassword, and mydatabase with the desired username, password, and database name in the docker-coompose file.

To connect to the PostgreSQL database from your application, use the following connection string:

```
postgres://myuser:mypassword
```

Once you have installed PostgreSQL, you can create a database and start using it in your application by connecting to it using a database driver, such as the pgx driver for Go.

To learn more about PostgreSQL, you can refer to the official documentation at https://www.postgresql.org/docs/.

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy the Golang microservice application using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory of the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infranyx/go-microservice-template
cd go-microservice-template
```

2. Create a .env file in the `envs` directory of the project and copy the `local.env` environment variables.

3. Run the following command to build and start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will build and start the following containers:

- `postgres`: PostgreSQL database
- `kafka`: Kafka message broker
- `zookeeper`: In the context of Kafka, Zookeeper is used to store metadata about the Kafka cluster and its topics. It helps the Kafka brokers maintain their cluster membership and elect leaders, and it also helps clients discover the location of the Kafka brokers.
- `redis`: Redis cache
- `sentry`: Sentry error tracking service
- `app`: Golang microservice application

## Verification

To verify that the containers are running, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

## Maintenance

To stop the containers, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

To start the containers again, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose start
```

To remove the containers, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This document outlines the design of the project, including the key components and features, design decisions, and technologies used.

## Key Components and Features

The project includes the following components and features:

- A PostgreSQL database for storing and querying data
- A Kafka message broker for reliable, scalable event streaming
- A Redis cache for improving performance and reducing load on the database
- A gRPC API for efficient communication between services
- An Echo framework for building HTTP APIs and web applications
- Sentry integration for error tracking and reporting

## Design Decisions

The following design decisions were made:

- PostgreSQL was chosen as the primary data store because of its robust support for ACID transactions and ability to handle large volumes of data.
- Kafka was chosen as the message broker because of its high performance and ability to handle large amounts of data.
- Redis was chosen as the cache because of its in-memory storage and ability to support multiple data structures.
- gRPC was chosen as the API technology because of its efficient binary encoding and ability to support streaming requests and responses.
- Echo was chosen as the web framework because of its lightweight and easy-to-use design.
- Sentry was chosen for error tracking and reporting because of its comprehensive feature set and integrations with a wide range of technologies.
- The project follows a clean architecture design pattern, with separate layers for the domain logic, application logic, and infrastructure. - This helps to improve the maintainability and testability of the codebase.

## Error Handling

The project includes a custom error implementation to handle errors in a consistent and structured way. The custom error implementation includes a set of predefined error types for different categories of errors, such as application errors, bad request errors, conflict errors, and so on. This allows us to classify and handle errors in a standardized way, making it easier to understand and debug issues that may arise.

The custom error implementation is located in the error package in the pkg directory. It includes the following error types:

- `ApplicationError`: Represents an error that occurs within the application logic, such as a failure to process a request or a failure to access a required resource.
- `BadRequestError`: Represents an error that occurs when the request is invalid or malformed, such as a missing or invalid parameter.
- `ConflictError`: Represents an error that occurs when the request cannot be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource, such as a duplicate key error.
- `DomainError`: Represents an error that occurs within the domain logic, such as a failure to meet a business rule or a failure to access a required domain resource.
- `ForbiddenError`: Represents an error that occurs when the request is forbidden, such as when the user does not have the necessary permissions to access the resource.
- `InternalError`: Represents an error that occurs within the infrastructure layer, such as a failure to connect to a database or a failure to access a required service.
- `MarshalingError`: Represents an error that occurs when marshaling or unmarshaling data, such as when converting between different data formats.
- `NotFoundError`: Represents an error that occurs when the requested resource is not found.
- `UnauthorizedError`: Represents an error that occurs when the request is unauthorized, such as when the user is not authenticated or does not have the necessary permissions to access the resource.
- `ValidationError`: Represents an error that occurs when the request data is invalid, such as when a required field is missing or a field is in the wrong format.

The custom error implementation also includes utility functions for creating and wrapping errors, as well as functions for handling and responding to errors in different contexts, such as when handling HTTP requests or when working with gRPC.

To use the custom error implementation, the application code can import the error package and use the error types and utility functions as needed. For example, to create a new BadRequestError, the code can use the NewBadRequestError function:

```golang
import "project/pkg/error/custum_errors"

err := customErrors.NewBadRequestError("invalid parameter", code)
```

To wrap an existing error with a custom error type, the code can use the WrapError function:

```golang
import "project/pkg/error/custum_errors"

err := customErrors.NewBadRequestErrorWrap(err, "invalid parameter", code)
```

## Diagrams and Mockups

To include diagrams or mockups in the design.md file to illustrate the design of your project, you will need to create these visualizations using a diagramming tool or software. Here are a few options for creating diagrams and mockups:

- dbdiagram.io: an online tool for creating and sharing database diagrams. It allows you to design the schema of your database visually, using a simple drag-and-drop interface. You can add tables, columns, and relationships to the diagram, and customize the appearance of the elements using a range of formatting options.
- Draw.io: A web-based diagramming tool that allows you to create a wide range of diagrams, including flowcharts, mind maps, and UML diagrams.
- Lucidchart: A web-based diagramming tool that offers a range of templates and shapes for creating professional-quality diagrams.
- Figma: A web-based design and prototyping tool that allows you to create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes for web and mobile applications.

Once you have created the diagrams or mockups that you want to include in the design.md file, you can add them to the file by including the images inline or by linking to the images.

[Include any relevant diagrams or mockups to illustrate the design]

// docs/requirement/user-consents.md
User consents (persetujuan pengguna) adalah komponen penting dalam OAuth2 yang berfungsi untuk mencatat dan mengelola izin yang diberikan pengguna kepada aplikasi client. Mari saya jelaskan lebih detail:
OAuth2 Consent Flow and ManagementClick to open diagram
Fungsi utama menyimpan user consents:

Transparansi dan Kontrol

Mencatat secara eksplisit izin apa saja yang diberikan user kepada aplikasi
User bisa melihat aplikasi mana saja yang memiliki akses ke akunnya
User bisa mencabut akses aplikasi kapan saja


Automated Authorization

Menghindari user harus menyetujui ulang setiap kali aplikasi yang sama meminta akses
Mempercepat proses autentikasi untuk aplikasi yang sudah disetujui sebelumnya


Granular Permission Control

Menyimpan scope spesifik yang diizinkan untuk setiap aplikasi
Memungkinkan user memberikan akses terbatas (misal: read-only)
Memungkinkan update izin tanpa harus mencabut semua akses



Contoh struktur tabel user_consents:
```aiignore
TABLE user_consents (
id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
user_id UUID NOT NULL,
client_id UUID NOT NULL,
scopes TEXT[] NOT NULL,
created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
last_used_at TIMESTAMP,
expires_at TIMESTAMP,
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(id)
);  
```

Use cases penting:

Security Audit

Melacak kapan dan kepada siapa user memberikan akses
Membantu dalam investigasi jika terjadi masalah keamanan
Memastikan compliance dengan regulasi privacy


User Experience
```curl
// Contoh response GET /oauth/consents
{
  "consents": [
    {
      "client_name": "Spotify App",
      "scopes": ["read_profile", "read_playlist"],
      "last_used": "2024-11-26T10:00:00Z",
      "granted_at": "2024-10-01T14:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```
Revocation Management

Saat user mencabut akses:

Hapus consent record
Revoke semua active tokens
Batalkan semua refresh tokens
Kirim notifikasi ke client (optional)




Compliance & Privacy

Membantu memenuhi requirement GDPR tentang consent
Menyediakan audit trail untuk privacy compliance
Memungkinkan user mengexport data consent mereka



Best practices implementasi:

Selalu timestamp setiap consent record
Implement soft delete untuk history audit
Set up automatic cleanup untuk expired consents
Provide clear UI untuk user memanage consents
Implement webhook notifications untuk consent changes

Apakah Anda ingin saya menjelaskan lebih detail tentang implementasi spesifik atau aspek tertentu dari consent management?
